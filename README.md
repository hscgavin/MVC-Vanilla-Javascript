# MVC vanilla Js

MVC JS

## Techs


data source is `http://marketplace.envato.com/api/edge/popular:themeforest.json`. CORS is enabled on this API.

- List items in order of rating, from highest to lowest.

- Show each item's thumbnail image, name and rating. The name and image should link to the item's URL. 

- 5-star items should have a yellow background, as shown in the mockup.

- The page should be responsive.

- Clicking an item's `remove` link should remove it from the list (purely client side, this doesn't need to be communicated to the server or maintained across page reloads).

## Getting started

3 files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

open index.html on browser


### Tests

A `tests.html` that includes the simple [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) testing library.
